### Dependencies
Python 3.8 or newer is required, and should be present in your system PATH
environment variable.

Generating and building OpenGL programs requires clang to be installed and in
PATH as well.

To run tests, you will also need the python modules mypy and pytest, which can be
installed via pip.

### Installation
`python setup.py develop --user`

### Usage
Modify `example.data` to specify your program, and then run `build.bat`.  This will
generate `generated.cpp` and then it will compile your program to produce
`generated.exe`.

Shaders go in the `shaders` directory.  Additional behavioral hooks can be customized
via `user_code.cpp`.
